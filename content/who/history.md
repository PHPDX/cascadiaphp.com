Cascadia PHP's board of directors originally planned to take over the PNWPHP conference, but time constraints and a
desire to keep the Seatle PHP user group intact led us to pursue a new Non-Proit and a totally new conference instead.  
Our board contains Contractors, Consultants, Business Owners, Educators, PHP-FIG Committee Members, and over 90 years of
cumulative experience using PHP.
