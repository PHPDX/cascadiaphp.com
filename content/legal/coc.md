# Code of Conduct

*Cascadia PHP* is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
participants in any form. **Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
venue, including talks.** Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the conference **without a refund** at the discretion of the conference organizers.
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
and/or religion
Sexual images in public spaces
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
Harassing photography or recording
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate physical contact
Unwelcome sexual attention
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

### Enforcement
This policy applies to all conference participants throughout the entire University Place
grounds. This policy applies to pre and post-conference time spent with other participants such
as, but not limited to: hotel rooms, bathrooms, common areas (lobby, food court, other),
swimming pool and other outdoor areas. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the
anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or
other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any
actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning
the offender or expulsion from the conference **with no refund**.  
Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of,
disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

**We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social
activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!**

### Reporting  
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as
possible. **Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges.** Harassment
and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you
to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.  
You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous Report
You can make an anonymous report [using this google form](https://goo.gl/forms/IpkfAfmCdDPVzBPf2).  
We can&#39;t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and

ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we&#39;ll handle it as respectfully
as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won&#39;t be asked to confront anyone
and we won&#39;t tell anyone who you are.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from [the Geek Feminism wiki](

created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. This policy is based on several other policies,
including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Moose Finklestein and Beth
Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith,
and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of
LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.
